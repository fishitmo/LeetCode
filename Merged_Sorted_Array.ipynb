        "To merge two sorted integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2` into a single sorted array in non-decreasing order, with the result stored in `nums1`, you can follow these steps. This approach works in-place, utilizing the fact that `nums1` has enough space to hold the additional elements from `nums2` by filling the array from the end towards the beginning. This way, we avoid overwriting any elements in `nums1` that haven't been merged yet.\n",

        "2. **Merge in reverse order**: Compare elements from `nums1` and `nums2` from the end to the beginning, and place the larger element at the current position of the first pointer (`i`). Then, move the pointer in the array from which the element was taken.\n",
        "3. **Handle remaining elements**: If `nums2` has elements left after `nums1` is exhausted, copy the remaining elements from `nums2` to `nums1`. If `nums1` is exhausted first, we don't need to do anything because the remaining elements of `nums1` are already in place.\n",
